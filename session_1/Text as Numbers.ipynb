    "Does this seem sensible? Does this capture every thing that we would consider a separate word in the document? \n",
    "\n",
    "What about `isn't`? Is this one token (`isn't`), or two tokens (`is` and `not`)? Or `taxi cab`? Is that two tokens, do we care that `taxi` and `cab` are both used? Do we need this as a separate concept from `Uber`, `limo`, `Hackney Carriage` or `car`?. If we take it as one, do we miss out on other combinations like `black cab` or `taxi driver`? What about punctuation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just using `str.split()` works reasonably well on the sentence below. However, there are some issue with punctuation. Ideally, the brackets and the exclamation mark would be separate tokens. We will deal with this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have split our sentence into tokens, we can then create a **vocabulary**, which contains every unique token in the sentence."

      "RODNEY. I wanted to have a talk with you—an important talk——\n",

      "\n",

      "MARTIN. Of course it has! You’re fool enough for anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. I don’t consider a man a fool because he’s married.\n",

      "MARY. I’d rather the proposition came from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. What do you say to your present salary, and at the end of the\n",
      "year I will personally give you a check for twenty-five per cent of what\n",
      "Rodney has made.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Oh, that wouldn’t interest me at all.\n",

      "MARY. You told me what I’d done _already_ was worth $50,000 to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Merely a figure of speech, my dear. Let’s see, you’re getting $40\n",
      "a week, and....\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. $50, and I want $100.\n",
      "\n",

      "stating the facts and the consideration?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. You want it in writing? (_Crosses to table R. and sits_)\n",
      "\n",

      "As soon as you see Rodney, you’ll have to discharge me.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. I will, violently. I make a pretty good actor under your\n",

      "\n",
      "MARY. Great! You needn’t make the note long. Just a memorandum.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. (_Holding up paper_) How’s that?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. (_Reading_) I think that covers it—if you’ll sign it.\n",

      "MARTIN. (_Signing_) There you are. (_Hands MARY paper_)\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. (_Sits on table_) Thanks. Now, Mr. Martin, there’s just one\n",
      "question I’d like to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Go ahead, I’ll answer you anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Why is it, when Rodney’s been out of college for _two_ years, that\n",
      "it’s only the last three months you’ve been so persistent about getting\n",
      "him to work?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. It’s like this. You know old John Clark?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. The man you dine with so often?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Yes, friends and rivals for thirty years.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. He’s in Ivory Soap, isn’t he?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. (_Emphatically_) I should say he is—one of the big men there.\n",
      "We’ve fought all our lives over soap, but he’s never been able to lick\n",
      "me, and—well, I haven’t been able to lick him, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Perhaps that’s why you’re such good friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Perhaps it is. Anyhow, as it’s fifty-fifty in business, we’ve\n",
      "lately narrowed the fight down to a family matter. You know old John\n",
      "Clark has a son, too: Ellery—nasty, egotistical, self-satisfied young\n",
      "puppy.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. I know, I’ve talked to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Well, old Clark thinks Ellery is the prince of all modern\n",
      "business, and he kept pitying me so much about Rodney’s being an idler—a\n",
      "rich man’s son—it got on my nerves, so lately I made a bet with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. A bet!\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. I bet him thirty thousand dollars my son could make more in a\n",
      "year than his son could. So I had to get Rodney busy, and he’s got to\n",
      "make good. He can’t be such a pin-head as he looks! If there’s anything\n",
      "in heredity there must be something of me in him, and we’ve got to find\n",
      "it—we’ve got to develop Rodney, dig deep, maybe blast. If he doesn’t win\n",
      "out——\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. But he will, I’m sure he will.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. It isn’t just the money. I guess I’m a sentimental old fool, but\n",
      "I’m proud. I want my boy to be Rodney Martin, not just Cyrus Martin’s\n",
      "son, and I want to show old Clark that as a judge of character he’s a\n",
      "bigger fool than I am. If I don’t get that bet——\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. But you’re going to, I’m sure you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. By George, Miss Grayson, if I weren’t a bit old and on the\n",
      "shelf, I’d marry you myself. You and I could clean up all the loose\n",
      "change in America. (_RODNEY enters R. MARTIN, seeing him, changes his\n",

      "MARY. Fifty thousand cakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. To Marshall Field.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Then why did you send ’em only five thousand cakes?\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. Because after we’d got that much from one of your branch\n",
      "factories you shut off our supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. And we couldn’t get any more soap anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. (_Accusingly_) And you knew it very well. (_Crossing to R. side of\n",
      "MR. MARTIN_)\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. We’ve still got 45,000 cakes to deliver, if we can get ’em from\n",
      "you. Why let all that money get out of the family? It’s a business\n",
      "proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. No, it isn’t. Don’t fool yourself: I sent that telegram.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. What telegram?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. The telegram from Marshall Field’s ordering the 50,000 cakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. You sent it?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. That day at the office you were pretty game, son, and to tell the\n",
      "truth, I felt so sorry for you, I kind of had to do something, so I sent\n",
      "that wire——\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. So that success is all a bluff, too? (_Sits on sofa_)\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. But what did you do it for?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Well, I figured an order like that would stall off your\n",
      "creditors, and then I had fixed it with one of our factories to let you\n",
      "have 5,000 cakes at three cents a cake. I knew it would mean some ready\n",
      "cash for you from Marshall Field——\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. But how did you square Marshall Field?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Oh, I just wired ’em I’d be responsible, and, say—(_Turning to\n",
      "RODNEY, who rises_) you had a nerve to charge ’em sixty cents a cake—and\n",
      "I had to pay the bill! That shipment cost me $3,000 for $150 worth of\n",
      "soap. (_PEALE laughs_) That isn’t funny, young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. No, it isn’t: I thought we’d really made good, and all the time\n",
      "it was you behind us——\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. You see, my boy, even if you did nearly trim me, I’ve got a sort\n",
      "of sneaking fondness for you. Look here, son, why not quit? There’s no\n",
      "market for dollar soap.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. But how do you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. I had a letter from Marshall Field a few days ago asking me what\n",
      "to do with the soap. They hadn’t sold a cake. I told ’em to dump it in\n",
      "the Chicago River; it might help to clean it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. But you didn’t give our advertising a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. We only finished a great big advertising campaign in Chicago two\n",
      "days ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. I know the soap’ll make good—with that trade-mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. If your trade-mark was so marvelous, somebody besides your poor\n",
      "old father would have bought your soap.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. Oh, what’s the use? He doesn’t believe in advertising!\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Oh, yes, I do: sound, conservative advertising, but not the\n",
      "crazy, sensational stuff you go in for.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Oh, you’re just mad because the soap trust didn’t think of 13 Soap\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. Why, we wouldn’t touch a fool thing like that. If you deliver the\n",
      "goods, your goods will advertise you—that’s always been our policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. I’m sorry, father, but you are old-fashioned to knock the modern\n",
      "way of advertising. Why, do you know, the National Biscuit Company was on\n",
      "the verge of failing until they hit on the title, Uneeda Biscuit?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. And since then, they have had over four hundred lawsuits to protect\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. Their trade-mark made ’em. They value that trade-mark now at six\n",
      "million dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. Great stuff. (_Turning to MARTIN_)—and Spearmint Gum just as a\n",
      "trade-mark is worth seven millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. And the Fairbanks people count their trade-mark, The Gold Dust\n",
      "Twins, at $10,000,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Ever hear of the Gillette Safety Razor?\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. I use it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Tell him about it, Rodney.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. It costs you five dollars. Don’t you know there’s a mighty good\n",
      "safety razor for a quarter, and dozens at a dollar, but you use the\n",
      "Gillette because Gillette was there first; you buy his razor at a high\n",
      "price simply because of its trade-mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. (_With gesture_) Advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY _and_ PEALE. (_With gesture_) Absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. Ivory Soap in the magazines alone used $450,000 worth of space\n",
      "in 1913—and at three cents a cake wholesale, that represents 15,000,000\n",
      "cakes for magazine advertising alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. I don’t believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. Yes, and a lot of other guys didn’t believe that iron ships would\n",
      "float or that machines heavier than air would fly, or that you could talk\n",
      "to ’Frisco on a wire or send a message across the Atlantic without a\n",
      "wire. Pardon me, sir, but you want to get on to yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. Yes, father, you certainly do.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. And you’d better hurry up.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARTIN. You’ve got a fine lot of theories, but what have they done for\n",
      "those 5,000 cakes of 13 Soap out at Marshall Field’s?\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. Why, we haven’t really spent enough money advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. That’s true. Every time the American Tobacco Company puts out a\n",
      "new cigarette they start off by appropriating $200,000 to boom it.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. And I suppose they are a lot of boobs?\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. And think what other firms spend! I’ve gone into this thing,\n",
      "father——\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Yes, Rodney, let’s show him our list.\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. Sure, it’s an absolutely accurate list of what some of the big\n",
      "advertisers spent in the thirty-one leading magazines last year. Eastman\n",
      "Kodak, $400,000, Postum Coffee, $125,000, Arrow Collars, $400,000,\n",
      "Melachrino Cigarettes, $100,000, Welch’s Grape Juice, $100,000.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "how it pays, but you do know that it must pay or they wouldn’t do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARY. Does that mean anything to you?\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. Yes. Does it when you realize that those thirty-one magazines have\n",
      "only about 10,000,000 readers?\n",
      "\n",
      "RODNEY. And that there are a hundred million people in this country. Why\n",
      "just to appeal to one-tenth of the population, fifty million dollars was\n",
      "spent in magazines last year, and each year people are getting better\n",
      "educated—more people are wanting to read. It won’t be long before there\n",
      "are 25,000,000 people buying magazines, and you can reach all of them\n",
      "by advertising—get a new market, a new population to deal with. Think\n",
      "what national advertising is accomplishing! It sells automobiles, vacuum\n",
      "cleaners, talking machines, rubber heels, kodaks, washing machines,\n",
      "foods, clothes, shoes, paints, houses, plumbing, electric irons, fireless\n",
      "cookers—mostly to a lot of people who’d never even hear of ’em if it\n",
      "weren’t for advertisements.\n",
      "\n",
      "PEALE. But nowadays it isn’t only people who have stoves to sell\n",
      "or tooth-brushes, that are spending money on publicity. Banks are\n",
      "advertising for money, nations for immigrants, colleges for students,\n",
      "cities for citizens, and churches for congregations, and you sit there\n",
      "thinking it doesn’t pay to advertise.\n",
