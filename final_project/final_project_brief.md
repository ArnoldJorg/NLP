#### How will we mark your work?
Your work will be marked according to UAL Level 7 (MSc) assessment criteria. If you have any questions, please ask your tutor for clarification.<br>

You will be given a "Pass (Advanced)" if your project meets the Advanced criteria, or a "Pass" if it meets the Standard criteria, with verbal feedback. Please note, if you decide to follow into a Masters degree at CCI and would like to use this course for credits, you need to meet the advanced criteria.

#### When to expect feedback by
You can expect feedback within approximately 1 month from the submission deadline.<br><br>

#### Adjusted deadline
If you're eligible for the adjusted deadline, please email your personal tutor directly and CC the Programme Leader (Marysia).<br><br>

#### You're eligible for the adjusted deadline if:
- you are disabled, have a learning difficulty, or are neurodiverse,
- unexpected circumstances out of your control impacted your work on the final project (for example: illness, family situation, broken computer).
<br><br>
#### Late submissions:
- submissions up to 7 days late will get a lower mark.
- later submissions will be capped to a "pass" and may receive delayed feedback. Projects submitted more than 2 weeks after the deadline will be marked at the tutor's discretion.

### Project specification

#### 1. The Python NLP project:
- Example project topics:
  - complete an NLP dataset using techniques such as web scraping, web crawling, or working with APIs, and describe it,
  - manually create a text dataset and present insights into it using Python programming techniques.
  - create your own chatbot, or fine tune an existing one, and reflect on the process (Advanced).
  - create your own text (for example: song, poetry, review) generator using techniques tools such as Markov chains or RNNs. Advanced version: use a Markov chain and RNN, or similar methods, to generate text based on an input dataset, and compare the resutls.
  - another topic that allows you to demonstrate the skills listed in this Final Project Brief.
- The code should be available online on GitHub and consist mostly of .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) and .py (Python script) files. If it's too computationally heavy to un on your computer, you can provide links to publicly available Google Colab notebooks instead.
- You can edit the code from class for a "pass", or merge different files and look for your own resources for an Advanced project ("A" or "B")
<br><br>
#### 2. Project report:
- it should include:
  - a description of your code sources, data (if relevant), its source, and collection method if applicable,
  - a reflection on potential issues, biases, etc. in your project,
  - what you learnt during working on the project,
  - what challenges you encountered in the process and how you approached them,
  - what went well in your project,
  - what you would do differently if working on a similar challenge in the future.
  - an ethical statement including your take on the data, its sources, biases, and potential uses of your project,
  - an LLM (Large Language Model) disclaimer.
- it should be submitted in writing (.pdf, .docx, .odt, or .md file) and available in the GitHub repository.
<br><br>

#### 3. Links or files of exercises from class or homework developed throughout the course.
- these can be links to online coding platforms or links to code files shared elsewhere online.
<br><br>
#### 4. The optional supplementary materials can include:
- a different or work-in-progress versions of the project,
- documentation of your learning process and exercises,
- any other supporting documentation.
