### Final Project Idea: I will do a youtube engagement predictor

#### What should it do?

1. Look at different performance metrics and data (titles, descriptions etc) and then train a model on this data
2. The model should predict what the engagement and sentiment of a video will be based on the given metrics it already has




#### Steps:
1. Add metrics such as titles, comments, description, likes, meta tags and upload date to csv
2. Clean data
3. Stop words and punctuation should be handled for processing - including days since upload
4. Sentiment analysis and keyword extraction - Keyword extraction using TF-IDF
5. Train a model and predict engagement level
6. Evaluate model e.g precision call, accuracy
7. Plot Graphs & charts on sentiment analysis
8. Final Project report and github submission
