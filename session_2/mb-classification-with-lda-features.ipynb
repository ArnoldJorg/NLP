    "In this notebook we are going to perform classification on a text dataset using features from topic modelling. There is a similiar notebook to this that just uses Bag of Words as the text feature for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the [Myers-Briggs comments dataset](../data/myers_briggs_comments.tsv) that is scraped from the website [16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com/) using web-scraping code by Terence Broad. The [Myers-Briggs personality typology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) is a categorisation for personality types that result from a questionnaire that asks people how they make decision and percieve the world. The questionnaire breaks people down into 16 personality types, made up of four binary categories:\n",

    "\n",
    "The website 16 personalities offers these questionairres, while also giving information about each personality type. On this website people can make accounts, and when they have done the test, their personality type appears on their user profile. Each page has a comments section and this dataset is made from exhuastively scraping all of these comments, along with their associated personality type. In addition to the 16 personalities, the website goes further to add the `-T` and `-A` types (being 'Turbulent' and 'Assertive'), meaning they actual end up tracking 32 personality types (2 to the power 5). These personality types is something we will learn about in more detail in Personalisation and Machine Learning in Term 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use this dataset to do some classification, looking at the many different ways we can split this dataset to see which factors of personality are most easily predicted based on. Then we will look at different ways we might try and improve our accuracy with classification.\n",

Try some of the other individual binary distinctions, then see if you can train a classifer on all 16 of the original Myers-Briggs personality types. Can you then do all 32 different categories available to us in the dataset?\n",

Try [changing the type of classifier](#train-classifier) used to another one of the [many available classifiers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) in sci-kit learn.\n",

For instance you could filter out comments that are replies (using `is_reply` in the dataset) or filter out comments that are below (or above) a certain length. The `source_url` may also be something that you use to filter out particular comments. \n",

    "**Task E** If you are doing lots of experiments using the same preprocessing to the text (stemming / lemmatisation), can you perform this and then save that dataset to a separate `.tsv` file. Which then only have to pre-process once, and then can then load directly into your code each time you runa  new experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task F** Look for other classification datasets on [kaggle](). Can you adapt this notebook to work with a different classification dataset. You may want to make a copy of this notebook before making changes to a new dataset. "
