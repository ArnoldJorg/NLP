    "**Task 2** You may have noticed that we often get perfomance on one of more of the classes we have when we have a large imbalance between the numbers for each class (listed as `support` in our classification report). Try [changing the type of classifier](#train-classifier) used to another one of the [many available classifiers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) in sci-kit learn.\n",

    "**Task 4** Discuss with someone on your table:\n",
    "- What are the potential uses of a text classifier trained on personality characteristics?\n",
    "- What are the ethical concerns of using this dataset?\n",
    "- What are the potential misuses of this dataset? \n",

    "**Task A** Can you filter the dataset in some way. For instance you could filter out comments that are replies (using `is_reply` in the dataset) or filter out comments that are below (or above) a certain length. The `source_url` may also be something that you use to filter out particular comments. \n",

    "**Task B** Does using a stemmer instead of a lemmatizer effect the classification scores? What happens if you don't do any pre-processing to the text?\n",

    "**Task C** Can you add any stop words that are specific to this dataset? Does that improve classification results?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task D** Can you save the results from classification (and any other important meta-data) to a log file. This can just be an append only text file that you log the results of each experiment to, to make comparisons with later. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task E** If you are doing lots of experiments using the same preprocessing to the text (stemming / lemmatisation), can you perform this and then save that dataset to a separate `.tsv` file. Which then only have to pre-process once, and then can then load directly into your code each time you runa  new experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task F** Look for other classification datasets on [kaggle](). Can you adapt this notebook to work with a different classification dataset. You may want to make a copy of this notebook before making changes to a new dataset. "
